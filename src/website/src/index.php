		<p>A Complex Refrigerator and Organiser for Nutritious and Yummy Munchies (ACRONYM) is at the leading edge of the Raspberry Pi and Arduino smart fridge market. Have you ever thought about having a way of being able to keep track of what is in your fridge while on the move or even just to look at what you actually have while in for your weekly shop then ACRONYM is the solution for you.</p>
		<p>For our original concept of making a fridge contents and status being made available easily on the go we have developed a system using both the abilities and cost efficiency of both the Raspberry Pi and Arduino to implement a design that would be easy to replicate along with having the ability to be expanded in the future with new features.</p>
		<p>By using our straightforward web based interface, anyone using our systems can browse the contents of any of their fridges through the system, check the temperature of their fridges, whether theyâ€™ve left the door open, and the weight of their fridge contents to help them gauge how full it is. This can be checked from any modern web enabled device through our secure and convenient portal.</p>
