		<p>A Complex Refrigerator and Organiser for Nutritious and Yummy Munchies (ACRONYM) is at the leading edge of the Raspberry Pi and Arduino smart fridge market. 
			Have you ever thought about having a way of being able to keep track of what is in your fridge while on the move or even just to look at what you actually
			 have while in for your weekly shop then ACRONYM is the solution for you.</p>

		<p>For our original concept of making a fridge contents and status being made available easily on the go we have developed a system using both the abilities
		 and cost efficiency of both the Raspberry Pi and Arduino to implement a design that would be easy to replicate along with having the ability to be expanded
		  in the future with new features.</p>

		<p>Currently any users in the system can see the contents of any of their fridges on the system, temperature of the fridge, door status, and weight of the fridge.</p>

		<!-- <p>ACRONYM is an project for an Embedded Systems class at the University of Strathclyde Scotland. We have aimed to create a fridge system that will enable users, and carers  to monitor the status and contents of the fridge</p> -->
