				If you already signed in you will see your dashboard, if this is the case you may move on to the next step. Otherwise you will need to login, if you already have an account, or create an account. For this we required some information from you in order to identify you in the future. After logging in/ creating an account you will be taken to the dashboard.

			<h2>Step 2</h2>

				Now that you can see the dashboard. Navigate to the fridges panel, this can be done by either clicking/tapping on “Your fridges” or using the menu at the side (note: the menu may be collapsed on small screens as such use the hamburger icon at the top left to expand it). 
				</br></br>
				From here click/tap on the plus icon at the top right of the screen. This will open a dialog box asking for you to enter your fridges unique serial number. This can be found I DON’T KNOW ASK THE HARDWARE GUYS. Your fridge will now be added to the list of fridges that you are subscribed to and is displayed on the fridges panel. Clicking/tapping on the fridge you have just added will open up the detailed view for the fridge. From here you will be able to see detailed information about your fridge as shown below.
