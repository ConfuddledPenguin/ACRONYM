			Congrats on getting an amazing fridge system! The following is a comprehensive user guide to being able to use your fridge. If you are are looking to build your fridge then we recommend looking at our <a href="build.php">build guide</a> first.

						In order to set up your fridge you need to run through the following steps: 
						</br></br>
						Connect your fridge to a mains power supply. Ensure that the sockets connected to are capable of drawing 230V mains. Any lower and the device and onboard components may not function correctly, or at all. Higher than this may damage components and render your fridge unusable.
						</br></br>
						Connect your Fridge to the Internet via the rear ethernet connection for easy instant connection. The device will then automatically configure on any DHCP enabled network connection. (Alternatively advanced Wi-Fi configuration is available but this requires Advanced setup, and the attachment of a monitor and keyboard, or a connection via ethernet to another computer to offer an SSH connection.)
						</br></br>
						Now that your fridge is connected to our servers it will automatically update the application detailing its current status.

						<h2>Step 1</h2>
							<p>
							Navigate to <a href="https://acronym.ovh">https://acronym.ovh</a> and from here launch our application
							</br></br>
							If you already signed in you will see your dashboard, if this is the case you may move on to the next step. Otherwise you will need to login, if you already have an account, or create an account. For this we required some information from you in order to identify you in the future. After logging in/ creating an account you will be taken to the dashboard.
							</p>
						<h2>Step 2</h2>
							<p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
							Now that you can see the dashboard. Navigate to the fridges panel, this can be done by either clicking/tapping on “Your fridges” or using the menu at the side (note: the menu may be collapsed on small screens as such use the hamburger icon at the top left to expand it). 
							</br></br>
							From here click/tap on the plus icon at the top right of the screen. This will open a dialog box asking for you to enter your fridges unique serial number. This can be found on the side of the fridge. Your fridge will now be added to the list of fridges that you are subscribed to and is displayed on the fridges panel. Clicking/tapping on the fridge you have just added will open up the detailed view for the fridge. From here you will be able to see detailed information about your fridge as shown below.
